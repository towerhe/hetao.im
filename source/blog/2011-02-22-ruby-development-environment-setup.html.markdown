### Ruby Environment

#### Ruby with RVM

URL: [http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)

RVM is a command line tool which allows us to easily install, manage and
work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.

### Editor

*Vim + Janus: Carlhuda's vim Distribution*

URL: [https://github.com/carlhuda/janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)

This is a basic distribution of vim plugins and tools intended to be run
on top of the latest MacVIM snapshot.

### Testing Tools

*RSpec*

URL: [http://rspec.info](http://rspec.info)

RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD
is an approach to software development that combines Test-Driven
Development, Domain Driven Design, and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning.
RSpec helps you do the TDD part of that equation, focusing on the
documentation and design aspects of TDD.

*Capybara*

URL: [https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara)

Capybara aims to simplify the process of integration testing Rack
applications, such as Rails, Sinatra or Merb. Capybara simulates how a
real user would interact with a web application. It is agnostic about
the driver running your tests and currently comes bundled with
rack-test, Culerity, Celerity and Selenium support built in. env.js
support is available as the capybara-envjs gem.

*ZenTest and autotest*

URL: [http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/](http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/)

Automated test scaffolding for Ruby.

*autotest-notification*

URL: [https://github.com/carlosbrando/autotest-notification](https://github.com/carlosbrando/autotest-notification)

This gem set the autotest (ZenTest) to send messages to software as
Growl, LibNotify, and Snarl, displaying a window with the results.

### Utils

*rbtrace*

URL: [https://github.com/tmm1/rbtrace](https://github.com/tmm1/rbtrace)

rbtrace shows you method calls happening inside another ruby process in
real time. rbtrace works on ruby 1.8 and 1.9, running on linux or mac
osx. rbtrace is designed to have minimal overhead, and should be safe to
run in production.

*jammit*

URL: [https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit](https://github.com/documentcloud/jammit)

Jammit is an industrial strength asset packaging library for Rails,
providing both the CSS and JavaScript concatenation and compression that
you'd expect, as well as ahead-of-time gzipping, built-in JavaScript
template support, and optional Data-URI / MHTML image embedding.
